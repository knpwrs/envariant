# `envariant`

This is a small snippet that I found myself writing for multiple projects in
the form of an npm module. `envariant` is essentially a way to guarantee that
an environment variable contains a truthy string at runtime. If the environment
variable is not defined, `envariant` will throw. This is useful for [type
narrowing][tn] your environment variables that you expect to be defined.

## Usage

```ts
import env from 'envariant';

const DB_URI = env('DB_URI');
// DB_URI is guaranteed to be defined at this point, as long as there is a `DB_URI` environment variable defined.
// If there isn't a `DB_URI` variable defined then `env` will throw and this script will crash.
```
